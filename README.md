# CodingMemes
a repo for fun silly memes pics I found online :)

Here are my chain of thoughts on why they are funny to me personally:
### AWS1
Some companies spend 100k - 1 million every month on AWS! It is going to be outrageous if you mess things up in the prod.
### GO1
Rust "borrows" some features from golang (e.g. `panic`), but it is more straightforward in some devs' opinions.
### Go2
A miserable gopher on coffee :(
### Docker1
Yeah Docker is a great containization tool but sometimes it might occupy some "unexpected" resources.
### Git1
GitIgnore >>> Ignore lol.
### coding
Welp, only if vibe coding counts as coding...
